Further details are expected to be announced during the Budget 2024 presentation on 13 October 2023.\n\nHere are some questions and answers with Dr.Yeah Kim Leng, Professor of Economics and Director of Economic Studies Programme at Jeffrey Cheah Institute on Southeast Asia at Sunway University and Member of the Advisory Committee to Finance Minister (ACFIN) to provide a better understanding of the issues at hand:",
